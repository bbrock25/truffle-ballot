Starting wiht the proposal example on the public site for solidity / ethereum,
lets take that and migrate it to a tested truffle project.

What are some initial lessons learned:
* constructor parameters
* how to get the length of an array
* we cannot just print arrays back from the constract to javascript, need
  deliberate accessor methods for the individual entries
* public attributes can be accessed with a call method (promise)
* these tests are hard to read and gross
